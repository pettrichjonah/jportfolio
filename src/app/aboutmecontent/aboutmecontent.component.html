		I'm Jonah - {{age}} years old and from Austria.
		<br><br>
		Photography has by far been my biggest hobby since many years and I am still chasing every opportunity for a great picture.
		That's what I love about it: you can always try to see a well-known motive from a new perspective and thus create fascinating images, no matter how many photos you already shot of it.
		<br><br>
		On this little website I want to show you my latest and greatest pieces of work. Contact me if you need someone who knows to put things into perspective!
